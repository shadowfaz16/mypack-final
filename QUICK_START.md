## ⚙️ STEP 2: Environment Variables (5 minutes)

**Create file:** `/Users/shadow/Desktop/shadow/mypack/mypack-final/.env.local`

**Copy this template:**

```env
# === CLERK === (Get from https://dashboard.clerk.com → API Keys)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_

# === SUPABASE === (You already have these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ

# === STRIPE === (Get from https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_

# === RESEND === (Sign up at https://resend.com - Free tier!)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@mypackmx.com

# === APP ===
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
LAREDO_WAREHOUSE_ADDRESS=123 Warehouse St, Laredo, TX 78040
LAREDO_WAREHOUSE_PHONE=+1 956 123 4567
```

**How to get each key:**

**Clerk:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Your project → API Keys
3. Copy Publishable key and Secret key
4. Webhooks section → Generate secret (do this after app is running)

**Stripe:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Copy Publishable key
3. Reveal and copy Secret key
4. Webhook secret comes from Stripe CLI (see step 3)

**Resend:**
1. Sign up at https://resend.com (free: 100 emails/day)
2. API Keys → Create
3. Copy the key

✅ **Done!**

---

## 🔗 STEP 3: Webhooks (8 minutes)

### Option A: Production Setup

**Clerk Webhook:**
1. Clerk Dashboard → Webhooks → Add Endpoint
2. URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
3. Events: `user.created`, `user.updated`
4. Copy signing secret to `.env.local`

**Stripe Webhook:**
1. Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → Add Endpoint
2. URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Events: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy signing secret to `.env.local`

### Option B: Local Testing (Recommended First!)

**For Stripe (easy):**
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
# or download from https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli

# Login
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Copy the webhook secret (whsec_...) to .env.local
```

**For Clerk:**
- User sync will happen when you deploy (not critical for local testing)
- Or use ngrok: `ngrok http 3000` and use that URL

✅ **Done!**

---

## 👨‍💼 STEP 4: Create Admin User (3 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Start the app
bun dev

# 2. Open browser
http://localhost:3000

# 3. Click "Registrarse" and sign up with your email

# 4. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor

# 5. Run this (replace with YOUR email):
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-actual-email@example.com';

# 6. Refresh the app - you're now admin!
```

✅ **Done!**
